# 2 Chronicles 23 

## Chapter Outline

- Joash crowned, and Athaliah slain. (1-21)

## Verses 1-21

To look upon ourselves and each other as the Lord's people, should make us earnest in the discharge of our duty both to God and man. Thus was this happy revolution brought about, and the people rejoiced. When the Son of David is enthroned in the soul, all is quiet, and joyful. See 2Ki 11.
